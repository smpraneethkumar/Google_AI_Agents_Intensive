This is a truly transformative area.\n\nLet me elaborate on what \"De Novo Drug Design with Generative AI\" entails and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is \"De Novo Drug Design\"?**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery often involved:\n\n*   **Screening existing libraries:** Testing thousands or millions of pre-made chemical compounds to see if any show activity against a specific disease target.\n*   **Modifying known drugs:** Making small changes to the structure of existing drugs to improve their properties or target new diseases.\n\n\"De Novo\" means \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" De novo drug design refers to the process of **designing entirely new molecular structures from scratch**, specifically tailored to interact with a particular biological target and possess desired therapeutic properties.\n\n**How Generative AI Enables This:**\n\nGenerative AI models, particularly those inspired by deep learning, are exceptionally good at learning patterns and then creating *new* data that resembles the training data. In the context of drug discovery, this means they can:\n\n1.  **Learn the \"Language\" of Molecules:** These AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules, their structures, and their properties (e.g., how well they bind to targets, their solubility, their toxicity). Through this training, they learn the fundamental rules of chemistry and molecular structure.\n\n2.  **Generate Novel Chemical Structures:** Once trained, these models can be prompted to generate entirely new molecular designs. Instead of just picking from existing options, the AI can \"imagine\" and propose unique chemical compounds that have never been synthesized before.\n\n3.  **Optimize for Desired Properties:** This is a crucial aspect. Generative AI models can be designed with specific objectives in mind. You can tell the AI:\n    *   \"Design a molecule that strongly binds to protein X.\"\n    *   \"Design a molecule that is orally bioavailable and has low toxicity.\"\n    *   \"Design a molecule that is a selective inhibitor of enzyme Y.\"\n    The AI will then generate structures that are statistically likely to possess these characteristics based on its learned knowledge.\n\n**Key Techniques and Architectures Used:**\n\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecular structures and can then sample from this space to generate new, valid molecules.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs involve two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) that compete, leading the generator to produce increasingly realistic and novel molecular structures.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be combined with generative models to guide the design process towards specific property goals, iteratively refining the generated molecules.\n*   **Transformer-based Models:** Similar to those used in natural language processing, these models can process molecular sequences (like SMILES strings) and generate new ones with desired properties.\n\n**Why is this a \"Major Breakthrough\"?**\n\n*   **Expands the Chemical Space:** It moves beyond the limitations of existing chemical libraries, opening up vast, unexplored regions of chemical possibilities. This increases the chances of finding truly novel and effective drugs.\n*   **Increases Efficiency:** AI can design and prioritize potential drug candidates much faster than traditional, purely experimental methods. This significantly shortens the early stages of drug discovery.\n*   **Creates \"Tailor-Made\" Drugs:** Drugs can be designed with very specific targets and desired properties from the outset, potentially leading to more potent and safer medications with fewer side effects.\n*   **Unlocks Difficult Targets:** For targets that have been historically difficult to drug using traditional methods, de novo design offers a new avenue to explore.\n\n**The \"Dreaming Up New Chemical Space\" Analogy:**\n\nThink of it like an artist who has studied all the great paintings in history. Instead of just copying existing styles, this artist can now use their understanding to create entirely new masterpieces that are unique and innovative. Generative AI is that artist for molecules.\n\nIn essence, de novo drug design with generative AI is about using AI to **intelligently invent new molecules that are optimized to be medicines**, rather than just searching for them. This is a fundamental shift in how we approach the creation of new therapies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of de novo drug design using generative AI is rapidly evolving, with a mix of established pharmaceutical giants and innovative AI-native biotech companies making significant strides.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
