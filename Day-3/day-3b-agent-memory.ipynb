Now you'll add **Memory** - a searchable, long-term knowledge store that persists across multiple conversations.\n\n### What is Memory ❓\n\nMemory is a service that provides long-term knowledge storage for your agents. The key distinction:\n\n> **Session = Short-term memory** (single conversation)\n> \n> **Memory = Long-term knowledge** (across multiple conversations)\n\nThink of it in software engineering terms: **Session** is like application state (temporary), while **Memory** is like a database (persistent).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🤔 Why Memory?\n\nMemory provides capabilities that Sessions alone cannot:\n\n| Capability | What It Means | Example |\n|------------|---------------|---------|\n| **Cross-Conversation Recall** | Access information from any past conversation | \"What preferences has this user mentioned across all chats?\" |\n| **Intelligent Extraction** | LLM-powered consolidation extracts key facts | Stores \"allergic to peanuts\" instead of 50 raw messages |\n| **Semantic Search** | Meaning-based retrieval, not just keyword matching | Query \"preferred hue\" matches \"favorite color is blue\" |\n| **Persistent Storage** | Survives application restarts | Build knowledge that grows over time |\n\n**Example:** Imagine talking to a personal assistant:\n- 🗣️ **Session**: They remember what you said 10 minutes ago in THIS conversation\n- 🧠 **Memory**: They remember your preferences from conversations LAST WEEK","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🎯 What you'll learn:\n\n- ✅ Initialize MemoryService and integrate with your agent\n- ✅ Transfer session data to memory storage\n- ✅ Search and retrieve memories\n- ✅ Automate memory storage and retrieval\n- ✅ Understand memory consolidation (conceptual overview)\n\n#### 📝 Implementation Note\n\n> This notebook uses `InMemoryMemoryService` for learning - it performs keyword matching and doesn't persist data. \n>\n> For production applications, use **Vertex AI Memory Bank** (covered in Day 5), which provides LLM-powered consolidation and semantic search with persistent cloud storage.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ‼️ Please Read\n\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Callbacks are **Python functions** you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n\n**Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle.** When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n\n**Available callback types:**\n\n- `before_agent_callback` → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n- `after_agent_callback` → Runs after agent completes its turn  \n- `before_tool_callback` / `after_tool_callback` → Around tool invocations\n- `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` → Around LLM calls\n- `on_model_error_callback` → When errors occur\n\n**Common use cases:**\n\n- Logging and observability (track what the agent does)\n- Automatic data persistence (like saving to memory)\n- Custom validation or filtering\n- Performance monitoring\n\n**📚 Learn More:** [ADK Callbacks Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/callbacks/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/types_of_callbacks.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.2 Automatic Memory Storage with Callbacks\n\nFor automatic memory storage, we'll use `after_agent_callback`.

That's where `callback_context` comes in.\n\nWhen you define a callback function, ADK automatically passes a special parameter called `callback_context` to it.
